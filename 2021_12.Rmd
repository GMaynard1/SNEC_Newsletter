### SNEC supports a new generation of biologists

Give yourself a big pat on the back! Thanks to the contributions of our members, SNEC was able to make a donation to the [Hutton Junior Fisheries Biology Program](https://hutton.fisheries.org/) which provides paid summer internships and mentoring to high school students interested in fisheries.

### SNEC Winter Meeting Updates

For our Winter 2022 Science meeting, we are going to incorporate COVID precautions and offer multiple attendance options. Instead of having a large, one day event, we will offer three, mini-symposia (2-3 hours) throughout the region at:

1. UMass Amherst, 1/21/22 at 2pm at [Holdsworth Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/RpgZPykL7NCfSY5Y6)
2. UCONN Storrs, 1/22/22 at 10am at the [Biology/Physics Building](https://goo.gl/maps/duesG1fy8vTidFAc9)
3. UMass Dartmouth SMAST in New Bedford, 1/26/22 at 2pm at the [East Building](https://goo.gl/maps/K4BSD8eyj7BQNiqHA)

Masks will be required for in-person attendance, and the talks will be live streamed to provide the option for virtual attendance. We also hope to record the sessions so they can be viewed at a later time. Registration is now open [here](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsnec.fisheries.org%2Fmeetings%2Fmeeting-registration%2F&data=04%7C01%7Caarcher%40barnstablecounty.org%7C74af813134b742567cd808d9b3483abd%7C84475217b42348dbb766ed4bbbea74f1%7C0%7C0%7C637737945085250347%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=xEbCT5%2BeINNtPeIQPMr67%2BDhEgC7c6uFWphsjJQvjGM%3D&reserved=0) - please be sure to select the correct event for in-person registration! Registration will be closed the day prior to the events, so don't wait!

### Photo Essay: Aquaculture and Acidification Project
*Submitted by: Abigail Archer, Fisheries & Aquaculture Specialist with Woods Hole Sea Grant and Barnstable Cape Cod Cooperative Extension*

![Picture of Abby](2021-12/abby.jpg)

Follow along in [this photo essay](https://seagrant.whoi.edu/photo-essay-aquaculture-and-acidification-project) as Woods Hole Sea Grant and Cape Cod Cooperative Extension respond to a question asked by members of the Massachusetts shellfish aquaculture industry. Lab studies show that shellfish exposed to acidic conditions will have poor growth and survival. Is this happening now in the waters of Cape Cod? Will oysters and quahogs exposed to varying acidic conditions in their natural environment also have differences in growth or survival? Or will other conditions in the environment like the amount of food available, balance out the effects of acidic water?

### Identifying Common Approaches and Needs for Fisheries Dependent Data
*Submitted by: Gavin Fay, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology*

[Click here for more information](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/11/12/fdd-champions/) about the Openscapes champions workshops for Northeast fishery dependent data and open data science, organized by Gavin Fay (UMassD), Andy Jones (NOAA NEFSC), and Julie Lowndes + Anna Holder (NCEAS). This 2 month program brought together students, faculty, NOAA scientists, and other researchers through the region to discuss collaborative work practices, group work culture, and all things open data science. This workshop series was a great partnership between academic and NMFS in the region to improve workforce capacity.

### The Future of Climate Change Impacts on Coastal Biodiversity
*Submitted by: Michelle Staudinger, Science Coordinator, DOI Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center*
Updates from the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NE CASC):

A team of NE CASC researchers is working in collaboration with the National Park Service (NPS) in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (BOHA) to address the risks from sea level rise, coastal storms, warming waters, and non-native invasive species. For more information, check out the [full story here...](https://necasc.umass.edu/news/future-climate-change-impacts-coastal-biodiversity)

The NE CASC will announce is spring 2022 webinar series in January. [Past webinars are all recorded and available online here](https://necasc.umass.edu/webinars) and cover pressing topics such as coastal resilience, climate refugia, tribal engagement, and more!
