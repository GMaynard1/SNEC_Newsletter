## Announcements 

### Fishery Decarbonization Survey Seeks Participants

Vanessa Sedore (Brown University thesis senior) and Sarah Schumann (Fishery Friendly Climate Action) are looking for fishery ecosystem scientists to participate in an expert elicitation exercise focused on scoring the known and potential impacts of a range of decarbonization (aka climate change mitigation) strategies on fishery-supporting ecosystems. We welcome both young and established professionals, but participants must at a minimum be working towards an advanced degree in fisheries science, ecology, oceanography, or a related field. Please consider participating yourself, or spreading the word to others in your network who may be interested.

### The Structures of the Demersal Fish Communities of New Bedford and Gloucester Harbors, Two Massachusetts Urban Estuaries

> Geoghegan Paul, Michael D. Murphy, and Anthony R. Wilbur. 2023, Northeastern Naturalist.

We sampled the inshore fish communities of New Bedford and Gloucester harbors synoptically using identical gear for 12 months during 1998–1999. Although the 2 harbors are only 110 km apart, they are separated by Cape Cod, which is the transition between the southern New England (New Bedford) and the Gulf of Maine (Gloucester) biogeographic regions. The 2 fish communities were 69% dissimilar from each other using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index (B–C). *Stenotomus chrysops* (Scup) composed 80% of the catch in New Bedford Harbor, did not occur in Gloucester Harbor, and contributed 7.40% to the total dissimilarity between the harbors. B–C identified 2 seasonal groups in the New Bedford Harbor fish community: May–October and November–April. *Leucoraja spp.* (skates) comprised the most numerous taxon captured in Gloucester Harbor, accounting for 24.90% of the total catch followed by *Pseudopleuronectes americanus* (Winter Flounder; 24.16%), and *Gadus morhua* (Atlantic Cod; 22.52%). These taxa contributed 7.23%, 3.88%, and 6.16% respectively to the total dissimilarity between harbors. B–C identified 4 seasonal groups in Gloucester Harbor: January, February and March, April and May, and June–December. These data provide an important description of the fish communities in the 2 harbors in different biogeographic regions at the end of the 20th century. We expect differences between the communities to decrease with increasing water temperature due to climate change.
