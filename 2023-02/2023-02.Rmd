## 2023 SNEC / NED Meeting Content

Thank you to all the folks who made the AFS SNEC/NED meeting in Boston possible! Three Cheers to the Planning Committee, Student Volunteers, Moderators, AV Crew, AFS HQ Staff, Poster and Oral Presenters, and Attendees. More pictures and experiences from the conference will be published in the Spring newsletter.

## 2022 AFS Annual Meeting Travel Award Recipients

Thanks to the generosity of our members, SNEC supported two students in their travels to Spokane, Washington for the AFS annual meeting last fall. 

Asha Ajmani is a PhD student at UMass Amherst and a Fellow at the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center.

> *Thank you for the opportunity to attend AFS 2022. I was proud to attend a
conference that focused so much on the value of Indigenous Knowledge, Indigenous
science, and Indigenous partnerships. It is hard to work in a field where Tribal
engagement is relatively new, and it is personally frustrating and isolating to be one
of the few people at my university engaging in this work; my goals and the goals of
the Tribal community don’t often align with the standard research milestones
guiding academia. It was welcoming and rewarding to participate in a conference
where we were invited to be a part of culture and science that highlights the
Indigenous ways of life, including deep connections to culture and nature. For the
first time in a long time, I felt connected to a community that appreciates this, and I
was able to network and make connections with others working with Indigenous
communities. One idea that really stood out to me was the concept of Indigenous
methodologies and how fish are “interrogated” throughout their whole life. From
Sammy Matsaw Jr., I learned that the Wolf-Teachings promote keeping our hands
off the fish. Using light-handed methods, or methods that provide more
information with less handling of the fish, fits in with these teachings and helps
advance more quickly towards a subsistence goal. These goals are higher than the
recovery goals set by state or federal management agencies. I would like to
incorporate this light-handed methodology more intentionally into my work, as it
aligns with the concepts taught to me by my Tribal partners and with my own
personal beliefs.*

> *AFS Spokane was an amazing opportunity for me to debut my dissertation research to
an important audience. I view professional conferences, specifically AFS, as an
essential development tool in the research process from start to finish, and not just a
time to communicate final results. The “Bringing new perspectives to marine and
estuarine fisheries” symposium, where I gave my oral presentation, provided an
excellent platform to share plans for my research, interesting preliminary results, and
work on developing my scientific communication style. Through my talk and time at
AFS, I was able to make valuable connections with professionals and peers ─
connections that will ultimately enhance my research products and broaden my
career avenues. This award also enabled me to take advantage of the Continuing
Education courses which taught me skills that I am now applying in my modeling work.
I am also a member of the Equal Opportunities Section and AFS was a great time for
us all to come together, meet folks with similar experiences, and move forward with
new energy to take on the challenges of bringing diversity, equity, and inclusion
principles to our profession. Thank you all for this award and for supporting me as I
work to achieve my goals.*

## Center for Coastal Studies Researching Shellfish Abundance in East Harbor on Cape Cod

The Center for Coastal Studies (CCS) Marine Fisheries Research program has been working closely with scientists and students from the National Park Service Cape Cod National Seashore and Antioch University to study horseshoe crab and shellfish populations in East Harbor, also known as Pilgrim Lake, a coastal lagoon in Truro and Provincetown on the outer Cape. The construction of the railroad in the 1800s isolated East Harbor from Cape Cod Bay, now connected to the Bay only by a culvert under Route 6 and Shore Road that for years functioned only as an overflow to prevent rainwater from overfilling the lagoon and flooding the highway. An oxygen depletion and fish kill in September 2001 prompted the Town of Truro and Cape Cod National Seashore to investigate options for restoring the East Harbor system, and in the following year, the Seashore began a [tidal restoration project](https://www.nps.gov/caco/learn/nature/east-harbor-tidal-restoration-project-page.htm), allowing the tide to run in and out of the culvert. The lagoon quickly turned from brackish to estuarine/saltwater conditions and water quality improved. Fish and shellfish returned to the system relatively quickly, but in the years following the restoration, their numbers fluctuated from year to year. 

![Plankton pumping](Nichols_pump.jpg)
*The CCS Toyota Tacoma often served as a mobile plankton laboratory this summer. A pump sampler designed and built by Marine Fisheries Research Director Owen Nichols operated off the truck’s battery, filtering plankton from hundreds of gallons of water. Here, Nichols deploys the pump sampler as Americorps Cape Cod service members look on.*

This summer, CCS Marine Fisheries Research director Owen Nichols collected zooplankton samples as part of a study of shellfish abundance and distribution in the East Harbor system. Nichols will be analyzing these samples this winter, comparing the numbers of bivalve (two-shelled molluscs like clams and mussels) and crab larvae in samples collected on incoming and outgoing tides in order to understand factors driving changes in the abundance of shellfish and their predators (such as the invasive green crab). While the CCS Marine Fisheries Research program often works offshore with the Cape’s commercial fishing community, we frequently respond to community concerns by looking inshore at the vital habitats of our bays, marshes, and coastal lagoons.

- The State of the Harbor Conference in Wellfleet, MA was cosponsored by the [Friends of Herring River](https://www.friendsofherringriver.org/), [Mass Audubon](https://www.massaudubon.org/), [The Center for Coastal Studies](https://coastalstudies.org/), [The Wellfleet Conservation Trust](https://wellfleetconservationtrust.org/), and the Town of Wellfleet. It included presentations about using eDNA to track winter flounder, herring restoration, and nutrient flows in the harbor.
